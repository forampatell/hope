                        <p class = "text">It was of course one of the good early morning of February 1996, till I heard the cry from the neighbor house. I jumped over the boundary wall and got into the house. I could see people sitting and crying at the hall. I looked at the room at the right side of the hall. There was my friend Madhu, hanging on a rope with a knot on his neck. I got frozen for a while and remained frozen emotionally for days.</p>
                        <p class = "text">We used to call him Tarzan. He was physically strong, very intelligent, creative and kind inside. But outside he was an alcohol addict, street fighter and socially unacceptable. He used to share with me about the traumatic childhood had had. The emotional hurts and physical pain that led him to hate his parents, himself and others. I was 16 and Midhu was 22 years of age at that time. His death left a major question on the purpose of my life.</p>
                        <p class="text">Millions of children are going through so much of suffering and pain due to several reasons from abandonment to extreme poverty. Many of them turn into criminal activities and substance abuse. God gave me a perspective on this and revealed His call on me to work for the next generation. That paved the corner stone for the organization HOPE. </p>
